						Not actually a cowboy but I do love a good felt hat and adventure. I&rsquo;m a Front-End
						Engineer building Notion&rsquo;s Marketing Site and telling the story of tools for work. In a
						past life I worked at Dropbox, Square (I really like cubes) after a tour with an agency and
						freelancing.

						I think the web should be a sandbox of infinite exploration to unlock our human potential for
						creativity and communication. Utilitarian tools and acid bath type experiences are the
						polarizing ends of the web I find most exciting to build.

				I find joy in bringing people together and creating a community, usually over a dinner party invoking
				the fine touches and wackiness of our patron saint of food Eric Wareheim. You should throw a dinner
				party for friends and strangers.

				While I&rsquo;m at ease in a city like San Francisco, I&rsquo;m captivated by the unfolding beauty of
				deserts of the American Southwest. Wherever I go I take a camera with me capturing landscapes or just
				the odd times we&rsquo;re in (friends included).

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>
				Writing is a new habit of mine to make conversations, thoughts and explorations more concrete and easily
				shareable. I write about the forgotten touches to interior design, adventure and sometimes technical
				explorations.

			<p className={styles.paragraph}>
				I&rsquo;m eternally optimistic about the future. Perpetual doom and gloom isn&rsquo;t something I mesh
				with. However, I do love discourse and debate.
			</p>
			<p className={styles.paragraph}>
				I love getting coffee with people and talking design, art, new web technologies, to mundane theories
				about urban planning.
